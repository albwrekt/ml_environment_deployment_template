# ml_environment_deployment_template
This is a deployment template for an environment supporting Machine Learning resources. This will continue to grow and evolve as resources change. 

This project is largely based off of Terraform and Docker for local PC Development. Resources can be built up differently or swapped in from different cloud providers as the cloud stack changes. 

All resources in this repository should be licensed to be free to use for individual developers in a non-commercial setting, but this is subject to change and the responsibility of the consumer to verify.
